1
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,910
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,260
Every magic trick consists of three parts,or acts.

3
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,790
The first part is called "the pledge."

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,190
The magician shows you something ordinary.

5
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,700
A deck of cards,a bird or a man.

6
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,740
He shows you this object.

7
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,900
Perhaps he asks you to inspect it

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,710
to see that it is indeed real

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,010
unaltered  normal.

10
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,230
But,of course,it probably isn't.

11
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,490
-Where do you think you're going? -I'm part of the bloody act you fool.

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,910
The second act is called "the turn."

13
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,360
The magician takes the ordinary something

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,170
and makes it do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,540
Now you're looking for the secret,but you won't find it

16
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,010
because,of course,you're not really looking.

17
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,280
You don't really want to know.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,890
You want to be...fooled.

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
But you wouldn't clap yet

20
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,290
because making something disappear isn't enough.

21
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,230
You have to bring it back.

22
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,230
That's why every magic trick has a third act.

23
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,970
The hardest part.

24
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,980
The part we call "the prestige."

25
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,890
The prestige? And did Robert Angier,the Great Danton,your employer

26
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,690
get to that final part of his trick that night?

27
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,530
-No sir. Something went wrong. -What went wrong?

28
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,330
I saw someone making their way below stage.

29
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,230
I followed him.

30
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,640
It was Borden,watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,040
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury,Mr. Cutter.

32
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,310
I'm an ingueieur

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,850
I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,010
So Mr. Cutter

35
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,350
was this water-filled tank beneath the stage

36
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,290
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,590
No. The tank...

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,890
was brought on for the first trick and then taken offstage.

39
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,260
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,840
How large was this tank?

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,600
It's a normal tank for escape under water about 400 or 500 gallons.

42
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,140
How do you think he was able to move the tank

43
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,770
under the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,710
He's a magician,ask him.

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,450
I ask again would this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,110
The Real Transported Man

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,260
is one of the most sought after illusions in this business.

48
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,920
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,690
If I reveal the method here,the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,890
How can we know that the tank wasn't simply some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,730
Mr. Cutter I see your predicament.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,170
But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,480
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,200
I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,970
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,140
Not my idea sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year

58
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,300
where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,450
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,120
I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear

61
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,450
is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

62
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,790
Check the locks...

63
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,630
...twice.

64
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,680
My name is Owens.

65
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,850
I represent Lord Caldlow,an accomplished amateur magician and...

67
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,750
How much?

68
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,920
-He is interested... -How much for my tricks?

69
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,390
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,050
Talk to Fallon,my ingueieur. Money's for him.

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,860
Yes,I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,760
All except the most valuable one,The Transported Man.

73
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,100
Well I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,570
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,940
If you are for the drop...

76
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,480
-your daughter is going to need looking after. -Fallon will take care of her.

77
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,050
Perfect,Fallon. A man with a past as obscure as your own.

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,850
The courts have motioned she be removed from his care.

79
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,460
She will be an orphan.

80
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,500
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse. It's better than here?

81
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

82
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm offering your daughter a future.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,530
As Lord Caldlow's ward,she will want for nothing ever.

84
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,630
Well. think it over.

85
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,780
And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith.

86
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,320
It might be of interest. Robert Angier's diary.

87
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,220
including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick.

88
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,950
-He never learned it. -Really?

89
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,580
On his return,he mounted a version of The Transported Man

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,600
that the papers said was better even than your original.

91
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,170
If you want Angier's secrets you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

92
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,270
I want your secret,Mr. Borden.

93
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,770
Consider your daughter.

94
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,360
A cipher  An enigma...

95
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,560
a search  a search for answers.

96
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Even if Colorado is the end of my journey

97
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,470
it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets.

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,640
See,the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word

99
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,620
but it will still take months to translate his writing. And to know his mind.

100
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,800
Well,my passion is equal to the task.


102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,640
Mr. Angier? welcome to Colorado Springs.

103
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,260
-The whole town has electricity. -Yes sir.

104
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Well. quite a reception.

105
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,520
You're our first guest of the season,Mr. Angier.

106
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,060
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.

107
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,750
As long as it takes.

108
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,090
I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.

109
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,790
Well  the peak's closed,sir. For scientific experimentation.

110
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes,I know. That's why I'm here.

111
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,820
You'll have to walk the rest,I'm afraid,sir.


113
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,690
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.

114
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,590
Not the welcome I was expecting.

115
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,600
I know you.

116
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,140
You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London Seven times

117
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,620
You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.

118
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,150
I'm Alley.

119
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,790
Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,490
-I've come to see Tesla. -Why?

121
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,530
He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.

122
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,190
-Can you get me a meeting with him? -Impossible,I'm afraid.

123
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,530
I've brought a lot of money.

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,230
I'm sorry,Mr. Angier.

125
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,270
I simply can't help.

126
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,740
I'll be staying at the hotel,indefinitely.

127
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,810
Hey,what am I holding?

128
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,990
Your watch.

129
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,500
Borden's journal entry for April 3 1897 describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

130
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,500
That was just days after he first met me.

131
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,530
We were two young men at the start of a great career

132
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,240
two young men devoted to an illusion

133
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,570
two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

134
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,210
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

135
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,900
If you would tie her wrists

136
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,540
bind her feet  around the ankle.

137
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,700
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

138
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,570
-No. -No.

139
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

140
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,250
He's complacent,he's predictable,he's boring.

141
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,010
Milton has gotten success,whatever that means

142
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,950
so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

143
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,850
He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired

144
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,960
-second-rate tricks...-They're all favorites.

145
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,670
Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

146
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,260
A bullet catch is suicide.

147
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,340
All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

148
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,870
-Use a plant. -You can't for every trick.

149
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,840
-No seats left for the punters. -All right,no bullet catch

150
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,380
whatever,but the point is a real magician tries to invent something new

151
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,310
that other magicians will scratch their heads over.

152
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,650
Then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

153
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,820
-What? -I suppose you have such a trick?

154
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,420
-I sure do. -Would you care to sell it to me?

155
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,120
No. No one else can do my trick.

156
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,320
-Any trick can be duplicated. -Wrong.

157
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,400
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece

158
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,730
he's prepared to do it.

159
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,260
Milton is a showman,but Borden is right

160
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
he won't get his hands dirty.

161
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,570
If you want to see what it takes to make real magic go to the Tenley.

162
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,440
There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.

163
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,840
-Chung Ling Soo. -I can't afford that.

164
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,580
I know the bloke run the door.

165
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,050
You two go and see that show,

166
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,120
and whichever one of you can tell me

167
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,160
how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.

168
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,460
-Which is? -Ten minutes onstage

169
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,430
with my old friend,Mr. Ackerman.

170
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,930
-Really? -Who's Ackerman?

171
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,190
The top theatrical agent in London.

172
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,300
I saw you drop the knot again.

173
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,810
-I turned my wrists. -Some nights you just don't get it,do you?

174
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,930
I mean,if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist she'll break her leg.

175
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,450
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,the Langford double will hold tighter.

176
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,210
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

177
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,480
If the rope swells,she can't slip it.

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,780
-I can slip a Langford underwater. -We can practice.

179
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,290
Borden,he said no.

180
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,790
You know knots better than me?

181
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,860
Listen,no more mistakes.

182
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,630
All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?

183
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
-Just leave. -I didn't think so.

184
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,670
-Hey,Cutter,where's he from? -Where are you from?

185
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,110
-He shifts props for Virgil at the hall. -Worried he'll steal your tricks?

186
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,580
-Doesn't deal in methods. -How do you know?

187
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,850
Because I hired him to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.

188
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,360
-I don't trust him. -He's a natural magician.

189
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,960
'Course you can't trust him.

190
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,860
I think he's all right.

191
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,360
-You think everyone's all right. -Even you.

192
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,230
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night

193
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,930
so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!

194
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,510
You're wrong. It can't be.

195
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,130
-Look at the man. -This is the trick.

196
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,840
This is the performance. Right here. This is why no one can detect his method.

197
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,220
Total devotion to his art.

198
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,390
A lot of self-sacrifice. You know?

199
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,160
It's the only way to escape all this

200
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,320
you know

201
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,440
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.

202
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,110
Or fish,look.

203
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,400
I don't know. Hang on a second.

204
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,510
He must be strong as an ox.

205
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,620
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.

206
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,050
Any time he's in public,any time he goes out.

207
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,220
It's unthinkable.

208
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,360
Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it.

209
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,130
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.

210
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,960
-You are pretending. -I don't think changing a name compares.

211
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,610
Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.

212
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,010
I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.

213
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,410
I thought of a name for you.

214
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,820
The Great Danton.

215
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,440
Do you like it?

216
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,790
-But it's sophisticated. -It's French.

217
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,920
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.

218
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,640
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

219
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,650
You bloody fool.

220
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,610
-He killed it. -It's OK.

221
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,610
-He killed it. -He didn't.

222
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,380
Look,now he'll bring it back.

223
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,530
No,he killed it.

224
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,860
No,he didn't.

225
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,870
Look,see,he's all right. He's fine.

226
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,040
-Look at him. -But where's his brother?

227
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,940
He's a sharp lad,your son.

228
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,680
Oh,he's my nephew.

229
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,000
You're the lucky one today.

230
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,880
Are you watching closely?

231
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
Look closer.

232
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,890
Never show anyone.

233
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,700
They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret,but as soon as you give it up

234
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,340
you'll be nothing to them.

235
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,700
You understand? Nothing.

236
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,400
The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything.

237
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,220
-Well,thank you for lunch,Mr. Borden. -You're welcome.

238
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,920
-Alfred,it's Alfred. -Alfred.

239
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,960
So I could use a cup of tea.

240
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,460
I can't allow...It's the landlord. It's not...

241
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,070
You think that's...Is that enough to keep me out?

242
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,470
I think so.

243
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,240
So I'll see you again?

244
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,820
Milk and sugar?

245
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,950
-What's in there? -Angier's machine.

246
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,090
You built this,Mr. Cutter?

247
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,060
Oh,no,sir. This wasn't built by a magician.

248
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,160
This was built by a wizard.

249
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,960
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.

250
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,510
Tell me,Your Honor,what happens with these things after the trial?

251
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,400
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

252
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,370
An avid collector,very interested in the case.

253
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,980
Yeah. Well,don't let him take this.

254
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,910
-Why ever not? -It's too dangerous.

255
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

256
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,560
The most disappointing of all,sir.

257
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,090
It has no trick.

258
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,830
It's real.

259
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,370
-This is the tank Angier drowned in? -Yes.

260
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,910
This is the place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

261
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,410
A standard magical apparatus for escapes?

262
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,950
Yeah,with one important difference.

263
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,020
This isn't a trick lock.

264
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,120
It's been switched for a real one.

265
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,190
What a way to kill someone.

266
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,200
They're magicians,Your Honor Showmen...

267
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,390
men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths

268
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,460
to amaze... to shock.

269
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,000
Even without an audience?

270
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,910
There was an audience.

271
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,900
You see,this water tank

272
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,280
was of particular significance to these two men.

273
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,350
Particularly awful significance.

274
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,080
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

275
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,000
If you would tie her wrists

276
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,330
bind her feet around the ankle.

277
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,610
Are either of you gentlemen sailors?

278
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,810
No.

279
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,190
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

280
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,700
Robert!

281
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,600
No,no.

282
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,840
Julia. Julia!

283
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,320
I knew an old sailor once.

284
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,490
They told me he went overboard tangled in the sails.

285
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:18,300
They pulled him out but it took him five minutes to cough.

286
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,410
He said it was like going home.

287
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,010
What do you want,Borden?

288
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,860
I'm sorry for your loss,Angier.

289
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,760
Which knot did you tie?

290
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,430
I keep asking myself that.

291
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,670
And?

292
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,500
I'm sorry,I just don't know.

293
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,110
You don't know?

294
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,610
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,720
You don't know?

296
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,190
You don't know?!

297
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,790
Alfred?

298
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,770
Good news. We got our first booking.

299
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,370
-I don't think we've had the pleasure. -Mr. Fallon is my ingueieur.

300
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,030
-Where did you get all...? -I had to borrow and...don't ask.

301
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,310
He's a very enterprising soul is...is Mr. Fallon. So...

302
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,850
We can't afford to pay him.

303
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,880
The money will come with the audience.

304
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,550
But what about until then? What I earn,it's barely enough for us.

305
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,850
Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.

306
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,660
You're going to be doing that with someone else.

307
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,930
-No. You're...? -Having a baby.

308
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,870
Oh,my God. We should have told Fallon.

309
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,840
That is great.

310
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,710
Oh,come here. Oh.

311
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,010
Alfred,what is this?

312
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,210
Oh,this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.

313
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,020
Is it the masterpiece,the great trick?

314
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,750
No,no,no,the world is not ready for that one yet.

315
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,230
This is just your run-of-the-mill,daring,spectacular bullet catch.

316
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,200
-A bullet catch. -Yeah,but it's safe. I promise. Look.

317
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,870
-Shoot me. -Shoot you?

318
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,100
Go on,shoot me.

319
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,710
-Right there. -No,I can't.

320
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,750
No,no,not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

321
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,080
-How's that? -That's very good.

322
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,950
-Tell me how you do it. -No  I can't do that.

323
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,030
-Well,then you can't do it. -I can't do it?

324
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
I'm sorry,but I can't raise a child on my own.

325
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,270
-You don't tell anybody that I told you. -OK.

326
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,170
Gunpowder.

327
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,830
Wadding.

328
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,340
Then the bullet.

329
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,050
Ramrod.

330
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,680
Hold out your hand.

331
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,660
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.

332
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,460
Once you know,it's actually very obvious.

333
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,530
Well,I mean,you still get...

334
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,640
It's dangerous. People still get killed doing that.

335
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,040
How?

336
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,180
You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button

337
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,710
or,God forbid,Sarah,somebody could put a bullet down there.

338
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Don't worry. Don't worry

339
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,320
because I'm not gonna let anything happen.

340
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,080
Everything's gonna be all right

341
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,420
because I love you very much.

342
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,830
-Say it again. -I love you.

343
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,340
-Not today. -What?

344
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,630
Well,some days it's not true,and today you don't mean it.

345
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,900
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.

346
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,410
I like being able to tell the difference.

347
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,480
It makes the days it is true mean something.

348
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,250
All right.

349
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,370
Metal rings,ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,180
If there are any ladies and gentlemen here.

351
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,620
-Solid metal. -Seen that already.


353
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,190
Who threw that?



356
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,150
This is what you came for,is it?

357
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,580
So... who wants to volunteer?

358
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,630
-I do! -Me! Me!

359
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,970
Me.

360
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,260
Are you man enough,sir?

361
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,920
Yes.

362
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,940
Which knot did you tie,Borden?

363
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,380
Which knot did you tie,Borden?

364
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,280
I don't know.

365
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,500
He came in to demand an answer,and I told him the truth.

366
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,670
That I have fought with myself over that night

367
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,310
one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot

368
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,720
the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.

369
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,080
I can never know for sure.

370
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,860
How can he not know!

371
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,360
How can he not know?

372
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,330
He must know what he did. He must.

373
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,010
Sarah,that bloody hurts.

374
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

375
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,840
It's as bad as the day it happened.

376
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,880
-We have to get a doctor back. -We can't afford the doctor back.

377
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,820
-You've woken her. -Great.

378
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,420
I'm sorry,I need this to heal so I can get back to work.

379
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,290
You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?

380
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,960
I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks.

381
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,430
I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about.

382
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,600
The one that they're gonna remember me for.

383
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,870
Come on.

384
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,400
I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.

385
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,100
Hasn't stopped your looking.

386
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,580
Heard about a booking.

387
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,380
Nice little theater. Young,up-and-coming magician.

388
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,950
-Who?  -You.

389
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,820
Me? Booking? Why?

390
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,890
I want to keep on working.

391
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,090
Who's going to hire the ingueieur that killed Julia McCullough

392
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,490
in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?

393
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,490
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

394
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,040
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.

395
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,660
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.

396
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,240
That's a dangerous trick,that one.

397
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,710
We'll have to whitewash the windows

398
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,290
confound the more curious members of the public,but it will do.

399
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,860
-We should see about an assistant. -I've made some arrangements.

400
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,420
You settled on a name?

401
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,040
Yes  I have. The Great Danton.

402
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,670
It's a bit old-fashioned,isn't it?

403
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,330
No,it's sophisticated.

404
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,940
The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

405
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,640
-Not like this. -I don't want to kill doves.

406
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,340
Then stay off the stage. You're a magician,not a wizard.

407
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,390
You got to get your hands dirty,if you're going to achieve the impossible.

408
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,160
In here,Miss Wenscombe.

409
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,690
No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit.

410
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,830
On the right.

411
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,100
What's so hard about this?

412
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,500
Nothing.You're going...down here.


414
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,470
-And this will conceal,right? -Oh,sure.


416
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,520
-Tighten up on there. -Yep.

417
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,150
This ties up here?

418
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,120
-Ties in the back. -Good.

419
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,090
Breathe as little as possible.

420
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,570
Now,you see?

421
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,040
-That's it. -OK.

422
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,880
She's not experienced,but she knows how to present herself.

423
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,850
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.

424
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,380
Thank you.

425
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,550
Ladies and gentlemen,for my final trick

426
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,390
I will require the assistance of two volunteers.

427
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,890
Mr. Merrit,if you would oblige me?

428
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,860
Yep.

429
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,630
Under?

430
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,570
Under,yeah. Come around his foot.

431
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,970
-Careful. -It's all right.

432
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,800
-Your volunteer,put their hand there. -Yeah?

433
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,020
And another one here.

434
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,860
If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage,please.

435
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,030
Thank you,Olivia.

436
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,000
You best not...

437
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,640
-be intending to hurt this animal,Mr. Angier. -Of course not.

438
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,040
Ready? Right.

439
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,770
One...

440
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,010
Two...

441
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
-Three.

442
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,650
That's bloody marvelous,Cutter.

443
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,880
Very nice.

444
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,190
And the best part is...

445
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,590
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.

446
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,170
Someday,perhaps you will. I just had to know that you can.

447
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,070
Very nice. Very nice,indeed.

448
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,080
I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.

449
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,580
It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.

450
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,580
-Don't worry. -You all say that. Why should I worry?

451
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,550
If your tricks don't get them in,somebody else's will.

452
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,890
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

453
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,420
Cheap thrills,Mr. Merrit.

454
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,220
People hoping for an accident,likely to see one too.

455
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,920
What would that do for your business?

456
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,340
-You got a week,John. -Thank you,Mr. Merrit.


458
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,720
Thank you.

459
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,410
Uh...Sir,in the third row there.

460
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,390
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.

461
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
This isn't mine.

462
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,290
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.

463
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,760
I believe she has yours.

464
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,960
Thank you

465
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,540
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes.

466
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,540
I'm so nervous.

467
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,240
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.

468
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,220
They've seen a lot of tricks before but not this next one.

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,190
Cloth over.

470
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,160
-Keep your fingers crossed. -I'll have the champagne ready.

471
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,450
-You've seen this one before? -We've seen them all before.

472
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,050
I'll make it a little harder then,shall I?

473
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,660
Two volunteers,please. A lady and a gentlemen To hold this cage with me.

474
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,030
I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves

475
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,030
or any other audience anywhere in the world.

476
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,730
Madame,place one hand on the back of the cage one hand on the front

477
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,780
Sir,one hand on the bottom of the cage one hand on the top.

478
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,790
-I should've spotted him. -You had a lot of plates going.

479
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,230
-Don't suppose we can do this again. -No.

480
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,200
-So,what's the climax of our show? -Show? You don't have a show.

481
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,960
We have a week's engagement.

482
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,770
To perform magic  not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.

483
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,380
Clear out,anything here in the morning gets burned.

484
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,880
It's done,John.

485
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,680
I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.

486
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,380
Well,there's plenty of good theaters.

487
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,550
If we can come up with a new trick,change the name of the act.

488
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,590
The name stays.

489
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Right,well,then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.

490
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,500
I have a couple of methods to try out.

491
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,970
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.

492
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,940
And if you need some inspiration

493
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,100
there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

494
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,940
Engineers,scientists,you know?

495
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,280
That sort of thing captures the public's imagination.

496
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,740
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

497
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,030
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

498
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,040
Two of them.

499
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,110
Beautiful,isn't it? God,I miss New York,though.

500
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,650
-Why are you here? -The lightning lives here And not much else.

501
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,910
Our work is secret.

502
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,450
That a cipher?

503
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,630
A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

504
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,630
Simple but time-consuming to translate,even with the five-letter keyword.

505
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
Which is?

506
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,640
We magicians have a circle of trust.

507
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,740
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

508
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,930
Maybe I bought it.

509
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,440
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there?

510
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,280
I've already found it. That's why I'm here.

511
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,580
Tesla built one for another magician.

512
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,030
-Why would you want the same thing? -Call it a professional rivalry.

513
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,830
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

514
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,590
But he would never talk about it.

515
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,710
I understand discretion. I just want the machine.

516
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,910
Finish your drink.

517
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,240
I want to show you something.

518
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,650
I think you'll have a special appreciation for our work.

519
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,220
-I thought it was a secret. -You're a magician.

520
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,050
Who's gonna believe you?

521
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,380
Not long now.

522
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,960
Our equipment requires a great deal of current.

523
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,960
Tesla electrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need them.

524
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,230
We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

525
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,000
Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.

526
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,890
Where are the wires?

527
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,520
Exactly.

528
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,940
-Where's the generator? -You saw it last week.

529
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,080
-That must be ten miles from here. -Fifteen.

530
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,240
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.

531
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,050
I'll send word for you in a few days,Mr. Angier.

532
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,250
Magic. Real magic.

533
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,360
Now appearing,only here at London's Royal Albert Hall

534
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,730
one of the miracles of our age.

535
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,030
A technological marvel.

536
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,430
You've never seen anything like it in your lives.

537
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,970
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.

538
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,200
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,ladies and gentlemen.

539
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,740
Free,clean power. Like to know the future?

540
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,280
The man who's speaking right now is going to change the world.

541
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,290
Come one,come all. Immediate seating,no waiting.

542
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,740
Ladies and gentlemen

543
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,780
objections have been raised...

544
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,040
They should be raised. Does that look safe to you?

545
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,740
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

546
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,780
against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.

547
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,360
We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.

548
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,990
Which he will not!

549
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,360
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.

550
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,830
This thing's gonna blow.

551
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,600
Ladies and gentlemen,please.



554
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,310
Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?

555
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,550
Sarah. I love you.

556
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,100
See,today it's true.

557
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,270
I saw happiness.

558
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,570
Happiness that should have been mine.

559
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,070
But I was wrong.

560
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,800
His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.

561
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,510
The family life that he craves one minute

562
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,780
he rails against the next,demanding freedom.

563
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,820
His mind...his mind is a divided one.

564
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,820
His soul is restless.

565
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:20,190
His wife and child,tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature.

566
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,370
So,what do you think you'll call her?

567
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,800
I don't know.

568
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,200
Everybody needs a name,so,what's hers?

569
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,870
Maybe Sarah.

570
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,650
That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.

571
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,950
Well,you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.

572
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,880
All right,go on,you talk with her.

573
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,420
Are they taking her away?

574
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,620
To the workhouse?

575
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,890
You keep talking.

576
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,800
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it. Go on,take it.

577
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,640
It's for the best.

578
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,620
Let me see.

579
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,690
-I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets. -Only if I teach you how to read.

580
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,530
They're just stupid tricks,right?

581
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,460
Haven't helped you get out of here,have they?

582
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,500
Or can't you undo real locks,professor?

583
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,370
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

584
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,380
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,get your attention

585
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,610
ask,"Are you watching closely?"

586
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,550
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

587
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,920
And then I'll be gone.

588
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,430
How'd you get so famous then?

589
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,560
Magic.

590
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,870
Borden,get back here!

591
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,510
Thank you.

592
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,410
Shut up!

593
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,810
Thank you

594
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,970
Where's the bloody key?!

595
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,080
February 8,1899.

596
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,230
Today,finally,a breakthrough.

597
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,020
Tesla's agreed to see me.

598
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,900
Perfectly safe.

599
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,090
So this is the Great Danton.

600
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,890
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.

601
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,270
Hold out other hand.

602
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,810
What's conducting the electricity?

603
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,280
Our bodies,Mr. Angier.

604
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,950
Quite capable of conducting and,indeed,producing energy.

605
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,550
Have you eaten,Mr. Angier?

606
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,620
I need something impossible.

607
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:42,170
You're familiar with the phrase,"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

608
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,940
Is a lie.

609
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,080
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

610
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,110
Society only tolerates one change at a time.

611
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,850
First time I tried to change the world

612
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,650
I was hailed as a visionary.

613
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,750
Second time I was asked politely to retire.

614
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,730
So here I am,enjoying my retirement.

615
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,170
Nothing is impossible

616
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,030
Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.

617
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,640
If I were to build for you this machine

618
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,470
you would be presenting it merely as illusion?

619
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,010
Well,if people actually believed the things I did on stage

620
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,770
they wouldn't clap,they'd scream. Think of sawing a woman in half.

621
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,820
Have you considered the cost of this?

622
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,820
Price is not an object.

623
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,860
Perhaps not,but have you considered the cost?

624
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,160
I'm not sure I follow.

625
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,060
Go home,forget this thing.

626
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,330
I can recognize an obsession.

627
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,490
No good will come of it.

628
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,470
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

629
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,730
At first,but I have followed them too long.

630
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:53,350
I am their slave. And one day,they will choose to destroy me.

631
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,710
If you understand an obsession,then you know you won't change my mind.

632
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,040
So be it.

633
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,880
Will you build it?

634
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,420
I've already begun to build it,Mr. Angier.

635
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,960
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

636
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,460
This will take some time.



639
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,360
Uh...I thought you'd gone.

640
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,490
I don't really have anywhere to go.

641
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,630
You've been sleeping here?

642
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,200
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?

643
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,610
Uh...research.

644
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,210
Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition,see what illusions...

645
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,140
You're going to do something to that man,aren't you?

646
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,110
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

647
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,720
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you...

648
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,480
Even?

649
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,580
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

650
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,660
He has a family now and he's performing again.

651
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,560
Borden is out there living his life just as he intended

652
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,790
as if nothing had happened and look at me.

653
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,840
-I'm alone and no theater will touch me. -Us.

654
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,470
You're going to need a better disguise.

655
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,620
I need a volunteer.

656
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,360
What happened?

657
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,520
Did you hurt him?

658
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,430
What happened,Robert?

659
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,270
You,sir.

660
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,810
Just a rubber ball,yes?  Thank you.

661
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,470
Just a rubber ball? No.

662
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,840
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

663
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,040
It's magic.

664
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,820
He had a new trick.

665
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,720
Was it good?

666
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,670
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.

667
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,870
Did they applaud when you saw it?

668
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,080
It was too good. It was too simple.

669
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,310
-The audience hardly had time to see it. -He's a dreadful magician.

670
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,020
A wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.

671
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,420
He doesn't dress it up how to sell it.

672
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,220
-How does he do it? -He uses a double.

673
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,990
-No,it's too simple. -This is a complex illusion.

674
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,570
You say that because you don't know the method.

675
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,900
It's a double that comes out. It's the only way.

676
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,230
I've seen him perform it three times.

677
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,880
-The prestige is the same man.  -No  it's not.

678
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,510
The same man comes out of the cabinet.

679
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,770
It's the same man.

680
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,420
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers

681
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,420
but,if you look closely,you can tell.

682
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,850
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience,but I do.

683
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,360
Yeah,we could use it as a climax to the show.

684
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,660
Yes.

685
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,060
The man stole my life,I'm gonna steal his trick.

686
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,430
-We got to find someone who looks like you. -He doesn't use a double.

687
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,940
I don't know how Borden does it.

688
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,480
Either...You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret

689
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,410
or you listen to how I would do it.

690
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,480
And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.

691
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,050
All right.

692
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,810
Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me. Whoo!

693
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,960
Look,look.

694
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,660
What's that?

695
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,930
It's for you.

696
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,870
What's this for?

697
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,670
Come.

698
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,580
-I asked you last week...-You caught me in a wrong mood.

699
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,150
But you won't ever...

700
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,850
Sarah  I'm gonna have to change my mind,aren't I?

701
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,760
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater

702
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,160
things will work out.

703
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,300
I can't believe it. Thank you.

704
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,370
Thank you. It's beautiful.

705
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,840
Gerry?

706
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,370
Darling,look at you.

707
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,180
Mr. Cutter,Mr. Angier,I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

708
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,720
A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

709
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,850
Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.

710
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,000
Yes?

711
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,190
Are you laughing now?

712
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,200
I have to take a piss.

713
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,710
-He's out of his mind. -Of course,he's an out-of-work actor.

714
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,680
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

715
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,680
But when I get done with him,he could be your brother.

716
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,380
I don't need him to be my brother,I need him to be me.

717
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,110
Give me a month.

718
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,400
So you open the door,and...

719
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,200
Come on.

720
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,840
-Couldn't you have found a softer one? -Well,it's not for sleeping on.

721
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,390
So,if you come down through there...

722
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,110
-does Root go up through there? -Yep.

723
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,260
It's going to be amazing.

724
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,560
Well,it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

725
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,000
The place was packed today.

726
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,400
You went and saw his show again.

727
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,940
Ready to meet yourself,Mr. Angier?

728
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,610
All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk

729
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,050
and no one will be able to tell the difference.

730
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,120
Have a little faith,sir.

731
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:40,160
Now,would you favor us with a performance,Mr. Root?

732
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,730
You'd drink,too

733
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,080
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

734
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,480
Did you think you were unique?

735
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,150
I've been Caesar,I've played Faust.

736
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:15,300
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

737
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,630
You can go back to being yourself now,Root,for nothing.

738
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,960
I'd rather be him for now.

739
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,940
I find it,uh...amusing.

740
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,410
"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."

741
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,450
-You look wonderful. -Oh,thank you.

742
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,710
Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him,the game's up.

743
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,830
I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know.

744
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,390
Have you thought what we should call it?

745
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,130
There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.


747
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,040
Ladies and gentlemen,much of what you've seen may be termed

748
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,440
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

749
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,170
Alas...

750
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,820
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

751
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,880
Watch carefully.

752
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,830
You will see no trickery

753
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,850
for no trickery is employed.

754
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,360
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient

755
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,730
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

756
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,900
Indeed,many of you may be familiar with this technique

757
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,100
but for those of you who are not,do not be alarmed.

758
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,340
What you're about to see is considered safe.

759
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,410
To our achievement.

760
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,750
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

761
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,150
At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

762
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,690
No one cares about the man who disappears.

763
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,620
They care about the one who comes out.

764
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,770
-I care about the man in the box. -Thank you.

765
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:28,130
I don't know,maybe we could switch before the trick.

766
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,400
I'm the prestige,and Root's below stage.

767
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,300
No,the anticipation of the trick is everything.

768
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,500
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

769
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,940
Once Root opens his mouth,it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

770
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,950
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

771
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,610
Root,you bloody fool,get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

772
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,310
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

773
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,480
Congratulations,all.

774
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,220
Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard.

775
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,990
We need to celebrate properly.

776
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,200
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

777
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,600
No,it's the trick. It isn't good enough.

778
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,970
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

779
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,980
He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

780
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,840
I need to know how he does it.

781
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,380
-Why? -So I can do it better.

782
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,990
I need you to go and work for him.

783
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,790
Work for him? Are you joking?

784
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,220
You'll be my spy.

785
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,460
We just got our start. You want me to leave?

786
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,660
That's how we advance. Think of it.

787
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,470
People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do

788
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,480
with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

789
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,050
He knows I work for you.

790
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,480
Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secret.

791
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,710
-Why would he trust me? -Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

792
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,090
Good girl.

793
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,830
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you.

794
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,340
Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage.

795
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,210
Your hat.

796
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,580
You might want to stand back.

797
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,400
I don't understand.

798
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,880
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

799
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,180
-Is there a problem,Mr. Tesla? -No.

800
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,880
-Come back next week. -Next week?

801
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,150
Next week,it will be fine.

802
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,090
Just a little temperamental.

803
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,800
-Interesting workshop. -Yeah,we make do.

804
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,300
-My name is Olivia...-I know who you are.

805
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,770
Here to steal the rest of my show?

806
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,740
To give your show what it's missing.

807
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,070
-Yeah,what might that be? -Me.

808
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,580
I was just saying that,wasn't I? A woman's touch.

809
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,580
I've left Angier.

810
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,480
-All right. -I want a job.

811
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,620
-I know you've no reason to trust me. -Why wouldn't I trust you?

812
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,660
You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

813
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,130
-Mr. Borden. -Alfred.

814
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,630
I'm going to tell you the truth.

815
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,470
Now that is a slippery notion

816
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,940
in our line of work,isn't it,Miss Wenscombe?

817
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,640
I am here because he sent me here.

818
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,280
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

819
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,110
What does he need my secret for?

820
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,680
His trick is topnotch.

821
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,520
He vanishes,and then he reappears instantly

822
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,520
on the other side of the stage,mute,overweight and,unless I'm mistaken,very drunk.

823
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,360
It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me,Olivia

824
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,670
does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

825
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,860
It's killing him.

826
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,030
He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

827
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,400
He thinks of nothing else

828
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,630
takes no pleasure in our success. And I've had enough.

829
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,240
There is no future with him.

830
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:29,080
He sent me here to steal your secrets,but I've come to offer you his.

831
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,140
This is the truth...is it?

832
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,350
Think you'd better get dressed,sir.

833
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,750
Root,you're late and more drunk than usual.

834
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,560
-Get down below stairs right away. -No.

835
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,230
No,we need to have a little chat,Mr. Cutter.

836
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,430
We have a problem. Cutter

837
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,170
Borden is performing right across the street.

838
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,970
Yeah,we have a bigger problem.

839
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:00,050
Root. He's realized that he can make demands.

840
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,210
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

841
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,550
I was surprised,to tell you the truth. It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.

842
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,520
-How much does he want? -It makes no difference.

843
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,090
-We've got to stop doing the trick. -Stop the trick? Look at this.

844
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,390
Last week they said

845
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,930
you were the premier stage performer in London.

846
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,660
Not magician

847
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,430
-mind you. Performer of any kind. -What's your point?

848
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,870
My point is,you've climbed too high

849
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,240
to get away with professional embarrassment.

850
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,640
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

851
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,640
Just pay him for now.

852
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,220
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.

853
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,760
All right.

854
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:48,450
Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.

855
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,020
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

856
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,570
-You're the Great Danton,aren't you? -Sh,sh,sh,sh,sh.

857
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,070
Of course I am,but don't advertise it,because I'll be mobbed with fans.

858
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,140
We paid him enough to keep him in beers.

859
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,440
You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.

860
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,180
Many of you may be familiar with this technique

861
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:10,980
but for those of you who aren't,do not be alarmed.

862
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:14,180
What you're about to see is considered safe.

863
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,660
And who are you?

864
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:21,660
I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.

865
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,990
Mmm. Very good.

866
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,170
-Another one? -Oh,if you insist.

867
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,250
-Another. -I'm not performing tonight.

868
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,140
I'm only doing one show,but to be frank

869
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,510
my people pretty much run things these days.

870
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,780
Get up there.

871
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,250
Get up!

872
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,590
Your illusion,The Transported Man

873
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,730
I'm not claiming to know your methods

874
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:58,890
but I had a similar trick in my act and,uh...I used a double.

875
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,400
Mm,I see,very good.

876
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:04,130
Well,it was,and then it went bad.

877
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:09,710
What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act

878
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,850
he had complete power over me.

879
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,650
Complete power,you say?

880
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,400
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

881
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,850
Huh. Thank you. Um...

882
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,180
Yes,thank you for the warning.

883
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,340
Hmm. Cheers.

884
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,080
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

885
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,460
What you're about to see is considered safe.

886
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,660
Oh! The Great Danton.


888
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,710
I apologize.

889
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,610
There simply is too much magic...

890
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,780
...for my stage at The Pantages across the street.


892
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:02,260
Pardon my intrusion.

893
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,760
-And go easy on the poor chap.

894
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:09,030
He does try so very hard.

895
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,470
I don't know how Borden found him.

896
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,440
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

897
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,540
Yeah,well,he did.

898
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,470
Do you think it was her?

899
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,550
You weren't expecting me?

900
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,390
I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

901
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,650
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

902
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,650
He's taken everything from me.

903
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,700
My wife,my career now you.

904
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,860
You sent me.

905
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,900
I sent you to steal his secret,not to improve his act.

906
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:45,540
-It's my job. -Or fall in love!

907
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,270
-I did everything you asked! -Yes? Yes?

908
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,970
-How does he do it? -Cutter was right,a double.

909
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,410
-'Course he said that. -He didn't say it.

910
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,350
I've seen things,makeup,glasses,wigs. We don't use for the show. I've seen it hidden backstage. Misdirection.

911
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,320
He leaves them lying around to make you think that.

912
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,260
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

913
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,400
All the time,Olivia! That's who he is!

914
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,860
That's what it takes!

915
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:11,400
He lives his act,don't you see?

916
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,730
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

917
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,240
You think you can see everything,don't you?

918
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:23,040
The Great Danton is a blind fool. His notebook.

919
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,240
You stole it?

920
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,180
I borrowed it for tonight.

921
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,380
I thought you could translate some of it...

922
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,540
I can't.

923
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,560
No one can. It's a cipher.

924
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:38,990
Even with the keyword,it will take months to decode.

925
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,100
-And without the keyword? -Perhaps never.

926
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,670
-We'll see. -We will not see.

927
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,770
If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it.

928
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,100
-Leave him. -I can't. He knows where I live.

929
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,440
This is his diary,Olivia.

930
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,240
All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

931
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,480
It won't bring your wife back.

932
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,810
I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.

933
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,430
Look,I'll,um...

934
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,630
I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

935
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,970
-He'll know you took it. -Yes,me. Not you.

936
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,900
Understand?

937
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,440
Robert.

938
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,680
I have fallen in love with him.

939
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,390
Then I know how hard this has been for you.

940
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,860
Notebook?

941
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,740
Then he's just getting started.


943
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,800
Good evening.


945
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,510
I'm walking tonight.

946
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,580
Let him come. I don't care.

947
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,150
Professor! Professor!

948
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,380
-You all right? -I'm alive.

949
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,640
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

950
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:27,190
-I'm impressed. -Why is that?

951
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,850
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

952
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,200
It's what a good trick costs,Angier.

953
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,700
Risk

954
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,100
sacrifice

955
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,300
The sacrifice,I'm afraid,is all gonna be yours  unless you give me what I want.

956
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,840
-Which is? -Your secret.

957
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,250
My secret?

958
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,680
Your method for The Transported Man.

959
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,450
Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all.

960
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,880
You have my notebook.

961
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,990
Useless without the keyword.

962
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,120
Write down your method,Mr. Borden

963
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,160
describe it in full.

964
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,840
I want the whole method,not the keyword.

965
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,410
I don't know if your secret's in your notebook.

966
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,850
The keyword is the method.

967
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,820
Where's my ingueieur?

968
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,570
-Alive? -How fast can you dig?

969
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,110
Fallon,you hear me? Fallon!

970
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,070
-How's the arm? -Still attached.

971
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,940
Did you find your answer?

972
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,910
Our answer,Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

973
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,550
I already know how he does it,Robert.

974
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,590
Same way he always has,the same way as we do.

975
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,120
It's just that you want something more.

976
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,850
Well,let's find out then,shall we?

977
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,700
What does it mean?


979
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,040
It means,Cutter,we have a journey ahead of us.

980
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,940
-To America. -Robert?

981
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,240
Listen to me.

982
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,550
Obsession is a young man's game.

983
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,660
-Come on. -I can't follow you any further in it.

984
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,620
I can't,I'm sorry.

985
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,420
Then the rest is up to me.

986
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,160
I'm sorry.

987
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,050
Good evening. Hello,darling.

988
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,580
Champagne,your finest.

989
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,720
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

990
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:01,820
-Absolutely,we are celebrating. -Miss Wenscombe

991
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,920
Mr. Fallon.  What are we celebrating?

992
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,530
We've hit upon a new trick. Haven't we?

993
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,600
-What trick,Freddie? -Yes,Freddie,what trick?

994
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:15,030
I am going to bury myself alive every night

995
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,970
and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.

996
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,040
-I think he's had quite enough...-No,pour the champagne.

997
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,940
Pour the...Sarah,don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child.

998
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,050
-Perhaps it would be better...-Mr. Fallon

999
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,280
escort her home. My husband's being a bore. Oh,please.

1000
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,550
I see no reason you should suffer.

1001
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,020
Don't ruin this evening.

1002
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:42,050
Good night,Mrs. Borden. Good night,Freddie.

1003
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,990
-Freddie? -That's my name.

1004
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:52,440
-Not at home. -I'm not always at home,am I?

1005
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:56,310
Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1006
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,140
Sarah,I just came from the bloody theater just now.

1007
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,010
All right? I'm out in public.

1008
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,310
-Everybody else loves it. -Why are you being like this?

1009
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,250
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1010
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,050
I thought that something very precious...

1011
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:15,130
...had been lost to me.

1012
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,390
So I just wanted to celebrate just a little.

1013
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,830
All right,what?

1014
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,730
What did you lose?

1015
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,680
I see,more secrets.

1016
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:32,740
Sarah,secrets are my life.

1017
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,810
-Our life. -No,Alfred,stop

1018
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:40,510
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1019
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,270
I thought I had the place to myself.

1020
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,820
Unexpected guests

1021
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:12,420
not very polite. A lot of questions.

1022
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,220
At first,I thought they worked for the government.

1023
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,260
-No? -Worse

1024
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,620
they work for Thomas Edison.

1025
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,400
Today,a most curious development.

1026
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:27,590
His assistant came to us with a proposition.

1027
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:31,670
Obviously,Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.

1028
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,570
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1029
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,410
He sent me here to steal your secrets,but I've come to offer you his.

1030
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,480
This is the truth is it?

1031
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,930
No,that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1032
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,900
...is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you

1033
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:01,440
like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1034
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,270
I hate him for that.

1035
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,440
I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1036
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,640
So,what could you possibly have to offer me?

1037
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,920
You may know his tricks but you can't understand

1038
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,560
why no one sees yours are better. You hide this.

1039
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,660
I had to look very closely to spot it during The Transported Man

1040
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:24,460
but this makes you unique.

1041
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,790
It shows you aren't using a double.

1042
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,060
You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly.

1043
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:33,500
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1044
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah,it does.

1045
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,100
So let people know.

1046
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:44,510
You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how.

1047
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,810
I think she's telling the truth.

1048
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,820
I think we cannot trust her.

1049
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:56,830
But I love her. I need her.

1050
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,190
To open myself to such a relationship

1051
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:05,240
to the dangers of such an affair

1052
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:10,110
I need assurances of fidelity,of love.

1053
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:12,700
But how to be sure?

1054
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,350
I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.

1055
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,180
How could he send you away?

1056
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,920
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1057
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,670
Today,my mistress proves her truthfulness.

1058
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,140
Not to me,you understand.

1059
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,270
I've been convinced since she led me to Root.

1060
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:46,240
Today,Olivia proves her love for me to you,Angier.

1061
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,310
Yes,Angier

1062
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,780
she gave you this notebook at my request.

1063
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:56,120
And yes,"Tesla" is merely the key to my dairy  not to my trick.

1064
01:22:56,290 --> 01:23:00,820
You really think I'd part with my secret so easily after so much?

1065
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,220
Goodbye,Angier.

1066
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,490
May you find solace for your forward ambition back in your American home.

1067
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,180
Tesla!

1068
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,380
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1069
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:26,750
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.

1070
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,650
-I never said he had. -You let me believe that he had.

1071
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,450
You stole my money because your funding was cut off.

1072
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:36,390
You've been shooting sparks in my top hat

1073
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,030
laughing at me all along,while using my money to stave off ruin.

1074
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,000
-I have seen Edison's men. -Where?

1075
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:45,140
In the hotel,I have a mind to bring them up here.

1076
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,330
That would be unwise,Mr. Angier.

1077
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,540
It is true that you are our last remaining financier

1078
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,480
but we have not stolen your money.

1079
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,010
This is my cat.

1080
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,150
When I told you I could make you a machine,I spoke a truth.

1081
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,720
-Why isn't it working? -Because exact science,Mr. Angier

1082
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:02,190
is not an exact science.

1083
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,450
The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1084
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,890
-It requires further examination.

1085
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,660
-So where did my top hat go? -Nowhere.

1086
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:13,600
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1087
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,100
The hat went nowhere.

1088
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,210
We need to try different material.

1089
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:21,040
It may provoke a different result.

1090
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,640
Great.

1091
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,320
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal,doctor.

1092
01:24:56,410 --> 01:25:00,080
I hope whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile

1093
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:02,190
Mr. Tesla.

1094
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,300
Alley!

1095
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:02,940
So the machine was working?

1096
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,640
I never checked the calibration,'cause the hat never moved.

1097
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:09,880
These things never quite work as you expect them to.

1098
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,220
That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1099
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:15,760
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1100
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:18,120
We'll send word when it's ready.

1101
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,430
Don't forget your hat.

1102
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,030
-Well,which one is mine? -They are all your hats.

1103
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,950
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1104
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:39,980
-Are we going to the zoo? -No,Daddy has some errands to run.

1105
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:42,140
-But you promised. -I promised,did I?

1106
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,480
Then go to the zoo,we shall.

1107
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,960
Daddy will go run his errands,and I'll be back before you know it.

1108
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:51,830
So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1109
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,260
Sarah

1110
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,460
what are you doing?

1111
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,140
Each of us have our vices.

1112
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,950
Sarah,whatever you may think...

1113
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,720
your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1114
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,220
I love you. I will always love you and you alone.

1115
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,460
-You mean it today. -Absolutely.

1116
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:29,600
Which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1117
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,010
More shopping. She does love the smell of money.

1118
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,620
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,so I thought you could take her,yeah?

1119
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:48,780
I mean,I can do it tomorrow,if not.

1120
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,420
And,uh...Sarah  she knows.

1121
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,460
Uh,at least she knows that something is not right

1122
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:02,090
so if you can just do whatever you can to help me.

1123
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,210
Talk to her,just convince her that I do love her.

1124
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:21,210
-What is it,Freddie? -Listen,don't call me that,please.

1125
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,450
It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong.

1126
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:26,320
I told you,when you're with me

1127
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,290
you're with me.

1128
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,590
Leave your family at home where they belong.

1129
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,470
I'm trying.

1130
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,130
I'm trying,Olivia.

1131
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,800
-I'll get dressed. -Yeah.

1132
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:41,200
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1133
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:43,640
There's something about that man I don't trust.

1134
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,780
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1135
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,510
He protects the things that I care about.

1136
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:30,160
We're sorry to see you go,Mr. Angier.

1137
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,890
We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave,as well.

1138
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,060
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1139
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:41,510
Mr. Angier  I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1140
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,200
What box?


1142
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:12,000
I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye.

1143
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:16,640
But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.

1144
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:21,850
The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.

1145
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:27,450
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field  where people are happy to be mystified.

1146
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,520
You will find what you are looking for in this box.

1147
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,990
Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.

1148
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,790
I add only one suggestion on using the machine.

1149
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,900
Destroy it.

1150
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:46,160
Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.

1151
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,540
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1152
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:57,140
Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.

1153
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,250
Today I tested the machine.

1154
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,880
Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1155
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:08,890
But if it went wrong  I would not want to live like that for long.

1156
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:31,580
But here at the turn,I must leave you,Borden.

1157
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,910
Yes,you,Borden

1158
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:36,320
sitting there in your cell

1159
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:40,520
reading my diary,awaiting your death

1160
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,750
for my murder.

1161
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,170
Angier's journal,that gesture of good faith,that's a fake.

1162
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:55,300
I assure you,it's not. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1163
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:00,040
And it's written in Angier's own hand,for which we have numerous examples.

1164
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,780
It don't matter.

1165
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:08,760
So my tricks.

1166
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,790
-All of them. -Including The Transported Man?

1167
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,930
-Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. -No,he won't.

1168
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,590
They're not complete.

1169
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,370
It's just the pledge and the turn for each.

1170
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,140
Without the prestige for these tricks,these are worthless.

1171
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:30,080
Yeah.

1172
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:34,210
You get the rest of it...when you bring my daughter here.

1173
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,150
I want to say goodbye.

1174
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,750
We have to go through it now.

1175
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:45,090
We have to go through it now.

1176
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,520
Now,listen to me,deny it all you want.

1177
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,990
Olivia means nothing.

1178
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,860
-Olivia? -I need an assistant.

1179
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,730
-I'll go to her,I'll tell her. -You'll tell her what?

1180
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,600
I know what you really are,Alfred.

1181
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,010
-I know. -Sarah,Sarah,Sarah.

1182
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,440
-I can't keep it in. -You can't talk like this.

1183
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,240
-No. No. -Sarah,shut up! Sarah,shut up!

1184
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,040
I don't want to hear it anymore.

1185
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:10,240
You can't talk like this.

1186
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,020
You can't hide it anymore,because I know,Alfred,I know.

1187
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,890
I know what you really are

1188
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,760
Alfred.

1189
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,630
I can't live like this.

1190
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,770
Oh,well,you think I can live like this?

1191
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:27,060
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1192
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,830
We have this beautiful house,lovely little girl,we're married.

1193
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,270
What is so wrong with your life?

1194
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,940
Alfred,I can't live like this!

1195
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,980
Well,what do you want from me?

1196
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,250
I...I want...

1197
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,550
I want you to be...honest with me.

1198
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:53,290
No tricks.

1199
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:57,330
No lies.

1200
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,730
And no secrets.

1201
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,680
Do you...do you love me?

1202
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,250
Not today.

1203
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,280
No.


1205
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,250
Who's there?

1206
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,160
I'm looking for an old friend.

1207
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,460
I heard about a booking,nice little theater

1208
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:05,790
good up-and-coming magician.

1209
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,440
-You're back.  -It's good to see you,John.

1210
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:11,970
Good rehearsal space.

1211
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,770
Blind stagehands,I like it.

1212
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,380
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1213
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,910
I need your help,John.

1214
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:21,780
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1215
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,480
Your last show?

1216
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,480
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.

1217
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:28,650
I'm almost done.

1218
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,390
There's one thing left.

1219
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,830
The Real Transported Man.

1220
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,670
You want to design a show around it?

1221
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,600
I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing.

1222
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:44,300
Call in any favors or connections you have left

1223
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,070
-to get us the right booking. -What sort of booking you after?

1224
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,480
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1225
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,580
Oh,what an honor it is to see you again,sir.

1226
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,090
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest.

1227
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,320
-It's a very clever trick. -Pleased to meet you,Mr. Ackerman.

1228
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,330
Likewise,I'm sure. Let's get on,shall we?

1229
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,170
Turn it on,gentlemen.

1230
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,100
Very pretty.

1231
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:36,730
That's it,Cutter? He simply disappears?

1232
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,730
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1233
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,370
-There has to be a...-A prestige?

1234
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,560
Exactly.

1235
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,530
Pardon me.

1236
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,740
It's very rare to see...

1237
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,610
...real magic.

1238
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,080
-It's been many years since...-Are you interested in helping us?

1239
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,750
Yes.

1240
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,690
but you'll have to dress it up a little.

1241
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,990
Disguise it.

1242
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,030
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1243
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,100
You haven't spoken about her,Freddie,not once.

1244
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,860
Why would I talk about her to you,hm?

1245
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:22,430
Because she was a part of your life

1246
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,770
and now she's gone.

1247
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,980
You know,the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1248
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:34,250
That she had something to tell me about you.

1249
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:37,750
I was such a coward,I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1250
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,590
But...

1251
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,960
...what would she have said?

1252
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:46,030
You want to know the truth about me?

1253
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:50,660
The truth is that...

1254
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,060
...I never loved Sarah.

1255
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,770
I never loved her.

1256
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,280
You married her,you had a child with her.

1257
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:04,140
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did,but the other part didn't.

1258
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,650
The part that found you,the part that's sitting here right now.

1259
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:09,780
I love you. No,Olivia,I love you.

1260
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,660
That's the truth.

1261
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:16,230
That is the truth that matters.

1262
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,630
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now

1263
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,390
talking about me that way.

1264
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:24,560
-No. -Yes.

1265
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:32,710
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1266
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:41,690
He's back. After two years

1267
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:45,520
he's got a new trick. They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1268
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:51,260
You should see the look on your face,Professor.

1269
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:54,100
You should go to him.

1270
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:56,640
You two deserve each other.

1271
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,540
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year.

1272
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,310
Then get rid of them. There will be 100 performances

1273
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,180
no more,no less.

1274
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,790
Five performances a week,no matinees.

1275
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:17,630
That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day.

1276
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,910
Ladies and gentlemen...

1277
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:45,750
my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk.

1278
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,950
Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown

1279
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:52,150
should leave now.

1280
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:55,300
When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion

1281
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:57,060
actually died performing it

1282
01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:00,430
you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.

1283
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,400
Let's begin.

1284
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:18,150
In my travels,I have seen the future.

1285
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:22,120
And it is a strange future,indeed.

1286
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:24,890
The world,ladies and gentlemen

1287
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:30,360
is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities.

1288
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:54,090
What you're about to witness is not magic.

1289
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:55,730
It's purely science.

1290
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:58,530
I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now

1291
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,600
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1292
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:00,250
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1293
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:01,620
Bravo!

1294
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,190
Bravo!

1295
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:14,200
Bravo!

1296
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:24,110
One hundred performances. Why?

1297
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,580
Does his method dictate that?

1298
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,650
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1299
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:33,520
He's a no-talent magician,and they call him the bloody best in England. Why?

1300
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,360
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1301
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:39,500
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1302
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:43,870
Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?!

1303
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,840
Why can't you out-think him?

1304
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,080
They do this every night

1305
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:06,420
after each performance. Yeah?


1307
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,420
We're done.

1308
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,030
All right?

1309
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,090
Let him have his trick.

1310
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:46,700
I don't need his secret.

1311
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,430
So...

1312
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:52,670
...don't go back there,you leave him alone.

1313
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,040
Both of us...just leave him alone.

1314
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:57,680
We're done.

1315
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,590
I told you,John.

1316
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,690
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1317
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,960
I would like to invite you onstage now

1318
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:17,260
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1319
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:50,690
-Hey,where do you think...? -I'm part of the bloody act,you fool.

1320
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:01,510
Who was that?

1321
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:02,760
Where's the bloody key?! Where's the bloody key?!


1323
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:08,940
Where's the bloody key?! He's bloody drowning!

1324
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:20,260
Hold on!

1325
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,960
What have you done?

1326
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:53,230
Alfred Borden,you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1327
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,020
You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1328
01:47:57,830 --> 01:48:00,820
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1329
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,230
Mr. Cutter?

1330
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,270
Owens.

1331
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,140
Oh,thank you for coming,Mr. Owens.

1332
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:13,610
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1333
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,370
But I notice from this manifest

1334
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:19,010
that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1335
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:23,120
Mr. Cutter,if you need to know where to deliver these items...

1336
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:26,590
No,it's just there is one particular item

1337
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,790
this item,in fact  I would like to...

1338
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,960
-You would like to? -buy.

1339
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,070
-Buy yourself? -Yeah,I suppose so.

1340
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,240
-This is the machine? -Yes.

1341
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:42,840
Well,I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item.

1342
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:46,010
Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1343
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:48,850
Out of the question,I'm afraid.

1344
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,150
Of course

1345
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:56,220
I suppose if,in the course of your delivery arrangements

1346
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:58,830
your paths were to cross

1347
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:03,160
-I can't stop you speaking your mind. -Thank you.

1348
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:06,860
-Still here,Borden? -For now.

1349
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,560
You got a visitor.

1350
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,730
Lord Caldlow.

1351
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,670
With a little girl.

1352
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,780
Jess?

1353
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,440
Hello,my love.

1354
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,020
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1355
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,220
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1356
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,620
Daddy,can I come in there?

1357
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,760
Not right now. Not right now,darling.

1358
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:39,460
No,but everything is gonna be all right.

1359
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,570
-You must be Lord Caldlow? -Caldlow.

1360
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,030
Yes  I am.

1361
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,370
I always have been.

1362
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:52,580
They flatter you with all those chains.

1363
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:55,720
Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball?

1364
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,010
I pulled you out...

1365
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,710
out of that tank.

1366
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:02,550
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician.

1367
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:04,590
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1368
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,460
I don't know what you've done.

1369
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:13,830
But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore,are you?

1370
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:15,840
No,not anymore.

1371
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,240
And I win.

1372
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,610
No one cares about the man in the box,the man who disappears.

1373
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,770
You win?

1374
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:27,720
This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1375
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:30,950
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1376
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,960
Oh,I know how hard it is to have someone so special

1377
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,750
taken away from you,don't I,Borden?

1378
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,220
And you can't take it with you,now,can you?

1379
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,160
Oh,she'll be looked after.

1380
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:46,830
-Goodbye,Professor. Come on,darling. -No,no,no,no,stop,my darling.

1381
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:48,300
Look,here.

1382
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,500
That's what you're after.

1383
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,770
That's what this is about.

1384
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,210
Take it.

1385
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,310
-Your secret? -Yeah.

1386
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,720
You always were the better magician.

1387
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,380
We both know that.

1388
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,250
Whatever your secret was,you have to agree

1389
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:09,520
mine is better.

1390
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:14,630
Don't do this. Don't do this,Angier. Jess,Jess!

1391
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,190
Jess,I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.

1392
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:20,840
-For God's sake. -I promise. Look!

1393
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:26,210
I promise.

1394
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,010
I love you,Jess. I love you.

1395
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,380
-Come on. -I love you. I love you,Jess.

1396
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:35,890
Angier! Angier!

1397
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,050
What,do you think this place can hold me?

1398
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:41,090
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1399
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:44,360
And you can put a stop to this now!

1400
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,620
Listen! Listen! That man...

1401
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,230
Listen,that man is the one I'm in for killing!

1402
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,340
Listen!

1403
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:53,440
-If he's alive,I'm not guilty!

1404
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:55,770
-I'm not guilty! -I don't care!

1405
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:57,930
-Get hold of him. -Angier!

1406
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,380
Run along now.

1407
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:08,840
Sir,there's a gentleman waiting.

1408
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:25,730
Dear God.

1409
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,200
Hello,Cutter.

1410
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:30,710
You're still alive.

1411
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,640
How is it you're still alive?

1412
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:35,110
I saw you on a slab,for God's sake.

1413
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,150
-Child. -Good night,sir.

1414
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,120
Good night,Jess.

1415
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:45,120
I've seen her before.

1416
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:50,600
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1417
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,960
-What have you done? -She needs looking after.

1418
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,400
She needs her father.

1419
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:00,540
You're letting him hang,and I helped you.

1420
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:06,620
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine.

1421
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:10,380
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1422
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,820
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again.

1423
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:19,220
Then,Lord Caldlow...

1424
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:22,660
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1425
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:24,200
My theater.

1426
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:26,490
It belongs with the prestige materials.

1427
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,630
John,I tried not to involve you.

1428
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,480
So...

1429
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,880
We go alone now.

1430
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,420
Both of us.

1431
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:58,300
I mean,I don't have as far to go as you.

1432
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:05,200
No.

1433
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,710
You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick.

1434
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:13,010
I'm sorry.

1435
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:17,190
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1436
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,450
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1437
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,860
Didn't mean to hurt her

1438
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:25,960
I didn't.

1439
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:30,230
You go live your life in full now,all right?

1440
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,930
You live for both of us.

1441
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:42,200
Goodbye.

1442
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:30,290
Are you watching closely?

1443
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:03,750
Put it down on the end.

1444
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:41,500
Take a minute to consider your achievement.

1445
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:47,030
I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me.

1446
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:49,300
Yes,he said it was like going home.

1447
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:55,250
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1448
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:35,960
Alfred Borden

1449
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:40,090
this day,in the name of the king and the High Court of England

1450
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,530
you will meet your end.

1451
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:47,100
No one cares about the man in the box.

1452
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:52,800
Cutter?

1453
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:59,110
Cutter!

1454
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:04,320
Do you have anything to say?

1455
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:09,330
Abracadabra.

1456
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,430
A brother?

1457
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,590
A twin?

1458
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:55,670
You were Fallon. The whole time?

1459
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:56,970
No.

1460
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:00,380
We were both Fallon.

1461
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:01,600
We were both Borden.

1462
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:10,690
Were you the one who went into the box?

1463
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:12,650
Or the one who came back out?

1464
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:16,020
We took turns.

1465
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,890
The trick is where we would swap.

1466
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:33,670
Cutter knew. Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple,too easy.

1467
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:36,470
No.

1468
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:39,080
Simple,maybe,but not easy.

1469
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:43,010
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1470
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,860
I don't understand,how it can be bleeding again?

1471
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:58,030
Wha...What about Olivia and your wife?

1472
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:00,940
We each loved one of them.

1473
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,670
I loved Sarah.

1474
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:09,940
He loved Olivia.

1475
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:15,550
We each had half of a full life  really,which was enough for us...

1476
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,490
...just.

1477
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,090
But not for them.

1478
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:28,430
See,sacrifice,Robert  that's the price of a good trick.

1479
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:33,700
You wouldn't know anything about that,would you?

1480
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,480
I've...I've made sacrifices.

1481
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,410
-No. -Yes.

1482
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,980
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.

1483
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:46,780
Yeah,it takes everything.

1484
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,900
No,no,wait,I'm not...

1485
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,180
It took courage.

1486
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:23,520
It took courage to climb into that machine every night

1487
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:29,320
not knowing if I'd be the man in the box...

1488
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:33,260
...or in the prestige.

1489
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:39,700
Do you want to see what it cost me?

1490
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:43,300
You didn't see where you are,did you?

1491
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:46,110
Look. Look.

1492
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,210
I don't care.

1493
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,150
You went halfway around the world.

1494
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:00,090
You spent a fortune.

1495
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:04,300
You did terrible things.

1496
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:08,300
Really terrible things,Robert.

1497
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,470
And all for nothing.

1498
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:15,410
-For nothing? -Yeah.

1499
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,550
You never understood why we did this.

1500
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:29,720
The audience knows the truth.

1501
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:34,320
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1502
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,590
Solid...Solid all the way through.

1503
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:45,100
But if you could fool them  even for a second

1504
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,370
...then you could make them wonder.

1505
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:52,050
And then you...

1506
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:56,940
Then you got to see something very special.

1507
02:03:00,830 --> 02:03:03,090
You really don't know.

1508
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:12,070
It was it was the look on their faces.

1509
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:32,250
Every magic trick consists of three parts,or acts.

1510
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:38,760
The first part is called "the pledge."

1511
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,830
The magician shows you something ordinary.

1512
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,700
The second act is called "the turn."

1513
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:50,070
The magician takes the ordinary something

1514
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:53,180
and makes it into something extraordinary.

1515
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,240
But you wouldn't clap yet

1516
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:59,480
because making something disappear isn't enough.

1517
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,610
You have to bring it back.

1518
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,080
Now you're looking for the secret.

1519
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,270
But you won't find it,because,of course,you're not really looking.

1520
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:52,360
You don't really want to work it out.

1521
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,740
You want to be fooled.
